The all and powerful Peaches has bestowed upon us these good values that we will follow:

* Document your code as you work because catnip doesn’t grow on trees
	* This will help other members understand your code, and make it easier for you in the long run (you won’t have to take hours javadocing in the end!).
	* Also include spaces and extra lines to make your code less blocky!
* Keep the master branch as a working copy without bugs
	* Use the specific branch for testing
* Use integration branches to help keep master clean
	* Make sure the teams are together when integrating
* Create specific branches by feature, not by netID
* Have good Git etiquette
	* Remember to pull before editing and pushing
	* Write descriptive commit messages
	* Create Git issues
	* Assign Git tasks
* Communicate with the team
	* Mark in progress code
	* Comment your code
	* Check Slack frequently
	* Make meetings with your team
		* Please also be prompt and show up! If you suddenly cannot make it, please let the rest of the members for the meeting know.
* Review others code [[and be nice about it!]]
	* Let them know if their code must be changed/if it is bad code (or it smells)
* Do NOT hard code
* Be honest in what you can/can’t do or what you don’t understand
	* Ask for help from your teammates!
* HANDLING CONFLICTS?
	* For design decisions, ask a superior
	* For other stuff, peer moderation
* Within each team decide, how much peer programming should be used
	* Working together makes you a better programmer

Consequence for not following these expectations: 
	* Has to write readme/documentation
