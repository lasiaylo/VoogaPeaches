Here is some of the feedback that we got as other people were trying our demo:


* Indicators should show what object in the library panel is selected

    * Should be able to deselect what has been selected

* Also indicators in the camera panel when things are interacted with
    
    * Be able to select multiple tiles in the camera panel to insert the same entity/object

* Recommend mouse usage instead of touch pad

* Have all library panel entities be click and drop instead of some click and drop and others drag and drop

* Reorganize the panels on startup

* Fix the naming panels functionality

* Also explain the minimap view

* Brian says "fix the bugs"
